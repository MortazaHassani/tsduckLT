## TSDuck - The MPEG Transport Stream Toolkit

### Abstract

[TSDuck](https://tsduck.io/) is an extensible toolkit for MPEG transport streams.

TSDuck is used in digital television systems for test, monitoring, integration, debug, lab or demo.

In practice, TSDuck is used for:

- Transport stream acquisition or transmodulation, including DVB, ATSC, ISDB, ASI and IP multicast.
- Analyze transport streams, PSI/SI signalization, bitrates, timestamps.
- Monitor and report conditions on the stream (video and audio properties, bitrates, crypto-periods, signalization).
- On-the-fly transformation or injection of content and signalization.
- Modify, remove, rename, extract services.
- Work on live transport streams, DVB-S/C/T, ATSC, ISDB-T, ASI, UDP ("IP-TV"), HTTP, HLS, SRT, RIST or offline transport stream files.
- Use specialized hardware such as cheap DVB, ATSC or ISDB tuners (USB, PCI), professional Dektec devices, cheap HiDes modulators, VATek-based modulators (e.g. Suntechtv U3, USB).
- Re-route transport streams to other applications.
- Extract or inject Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) between TS and UDP/IP.
- Analyze and inject SCTE 35 splice information.
- Extract specific encapsulated data (Teletext, T2-MI).
- Emulate a CAS head-end using DVB SimulCrypt interfaces to and from ECMG or EMMG.
- And more...
