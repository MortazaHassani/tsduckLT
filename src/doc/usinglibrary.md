# Using the TSDuck library   {#usinglibrary}

# Pre-requisites {#libreq}

To be able to build applications or `tsp` plugins with the TSDuck library,
you must install the TSDuck development environment first.

- On Windows systems, you must select the optional "Development" component
  during the installation.
- On Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS, AlmaLinux, you must install the package `tsduck-devel`.
- On Ubuntu, Debian and Raspbian, you must install the package `tsduck-dev`.
- On macOS systems, the development environment is always installed with TSDuck using Homebrew.
- If you build TSDuck from sources, use `make install install-devel`.

# Building applications on Linux, macOS and FreeBSD  {#liblinux}

The command `tsconfig` generates the appropriate build options for the
current operating system. See the TSDuck user's guide for more details.

The following sample makefile illustrates the creation of a simple
application named `myexec` using one single source file `myexec.cpp`.
~~~~
CXXFLAGS += $(shell tsconfig --cflags)
LDLIBS += $(shell tsconfig --libs)

default: myexec
~~~~
This is as simple as that.

Just run `make` to build the application.
~~~~
$ make
~~~~

# Building applications on Windows  {#libwindows}

The "Development" option of the TSDuck installer provides the build
environment for Visual Studio 2019, in debug and release mode, for
32-bit and 64-bit platforms. It may be compatible with Visual Studio
2015 and 2017, but without guarantee.

The environment variable `TSDUCK` is defined to the root of the
TSDuck installation tree. A Visual Studio property file named
`tsduck.props` is installed here. It provides all definitions
and options to use the TSDuck library.

Create the solution and projects for your application. Then, manually
edit the project file, named for instance `app.vcxproj`, and insert
the following line just before the final `</Project>` closing tag:
~~~~
<Import Project="$(TSDUCK)\tsduck.props" />
~~~~

Then build your project normally.
