//! of the application code. If the application is run later on a system with
//! a TSDuck library with a different version, the reference won't be resolved
//! and the application won't run.
//!
//! If we don't do this, the initialization of application automatically calls
//! complex "Register" constructors in the TSDuck library which may fail if the
//! version of the library is different.
