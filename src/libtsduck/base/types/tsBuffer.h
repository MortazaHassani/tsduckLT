    //! General-purpose memory buffer with bit access.
    //! @ingroup cpp
    //!
    //! A buffer has the following properties:
    //! - Internal memory space (freeed with the buffer object) or external memory area.
    //! - Access mode: read/write or read-only.
    //! - Maximum size (in bytes).
    //! - Read pointer (in bits).
    //! - Write pointer (in bits).
    //! - Error state (read error, write error, user-generated error).
    //! - Endianness: byte and bit order, used when reading or writing integer data.
    //!
    //! In a read/write buffer, both read and write pointers initially point to the start
    //! of the buffer. Then, the read pointer always remains behind the write pointer. In
    //! other words, we can read only what was previously written. The application cannot
    //! write beyond the current maximum buffer size and cannot read beyond the current
    //! write pointer.
    //!
    //! In a read-only buffer, the write pointer always points to the end of the buffer
    //! and cannot be changed.
    //!
    //! Read and write pointers are composed of a byte offset from the beginning of the
    //! buffer and a bit offset (0 to 7) in this byte. In big endian mode (the default),
    //! bit 0 is the most significant bit (msb) and bit 7 is the least significant bit
    //! (lsb). In little endian mode, bit 0 is the lsb and bit 7 is the msb.
    //!
    //! It is possible to read and write integer values of any number of bits, starting
    //! at any bit offset. Best performances are, of course, achieved on 8, 16, 32 and
    //! 64-bit integers starting at a byte boundary (bit offset 0).
    //!
    //! The two read-error and write-error states are independent. They are most commonly
    //! set when trying to read or write past the write pointer or end of buffer, respectively.
    //! When some multi-byte data cannot be read or written, the corresponding error is set
    //! and the read or write pointer is left unmodified (no partial read or write).
    //!
    //! Once the read error is set, all subsequent read operations will fail until the
    //! read error state is explicitly cleared. The same principle applies to write error
    //! state and write operations.
    //!
    //! For example, consider that the remaining number of bytes to read is 2. Trying to
    //! read a 32-bit data fails and the read error is set. Attempting to read an 8-bit
    //! or 16-bit data will then fail because the read error is set, even though there
    //! are enough bytes to read.
    //!
    //! Note: The principles of the C++ class ts::Buffer were freely inspired by the Java
    //! class @c java.nio.ByteBuffer. There are differences between the two but the main
    //! principles are similar.
