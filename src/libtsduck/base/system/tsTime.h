    //! The @c Time class implements a basic representation of time.
    //! @ingroup system
    //!
    //! The implementation is based on the operating system representation
    //! of time. This means that the range of representable time values
    //! may vary from one system to another. You may use the constants
    //! @link Epoch @endlink and @link Apocalypse @endlink as first and
    //! last representable time values.
    //!
    //! An instance of @c Time may be indifferently interpreted as a local time
    //! or UTC time value. Methods are provided to convert between local and
    //! UTC values. The accuracy of these conversions depend on the configuration
    //! of the operating system.
    //!
    //! The implementation of the class is designed to be light and fast so that
    //! @c Time objects may be copied without overhead.
    //! The class is not polymorphic, there is no virtual methods and no vtable.
    //! In fact, the actual representation is only a 64-bit integer.
    //!

        //! Wikipedia: << A leap second is a one-second adjustment that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
        //! to accommodate the difference between precise time (as measured by atomic clocks) and imprecise observed solar time
        //! (known as UT1 and which varies due to irregularities and long-term slowdown in the Earth's rotation).
        //!
        //! The UTC time standard, widely used for international timekeeping and as the reference for civil time in most countries,
        //! uses precise atomic time and consequently would run ahead of observed solar time unless it is reset to UT1 as needed.
        //! The leap second facility exists to provide this adjustment.
        //!
        //! Because the Earth's rotation speed varies in response to climatic and geological events, UTC leap seconds are irregularly
        //! spaced and unpredictable. Insertion of each UTC leap second is usually decided about six months in advance by the
        //! International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), to ensure that the difference between the UTC and UT1
        //! readings will never exceed 0.9 seconds. >>
        //!
        //! TSDuck uses a configuration file (tsduck.time.xml) to define the list of known leap seconds.
        //!
        //! The TAI (International Atomic Time) starts Jan 1st 1958. Before this date, there is no leap second.
        //! Between 1958 and 1972, there are globally 10 leap seconds but they are not precisely allocated.
