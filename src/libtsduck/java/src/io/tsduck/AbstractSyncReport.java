 * An abstract Report class which can be derived by applications to get synchronous log messages.

 *
 * Handling messages is performed synchronously, meaning that Java calls TSDuck which logs
 * messages which calls the Java message handler.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe. It shall be entirely used in the same Java thread.
 * This report shall be passed to TSDuck features which synchronously execute in the
 * caller thread only. Specifically, this class is not suitable for use with {@link TSProcessor}
 * (use {@link AbstractAsyncReport } instead).
