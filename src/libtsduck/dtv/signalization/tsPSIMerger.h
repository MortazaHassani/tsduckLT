    //! This class merges PSI/SI tables from two TS, replacing TS packets.
    //! @ingroup mpeg
    //!
    //! Definitions:
    //!  - Main stream: the main TS which will be modified.
    //!  - Merged stream: the additional TS the PSI of which will be merged in
    //!    the PSI of the main stream.
    //!
    //! The packets from the two streams are passed using two distinct methods:
    //! feedMainPacket() and feedMergedPacket(). The packets from the main stream
    //! can be modified to overwrite PSI/SI packets. Packets from the merged stream
    //! may be overwritten when they carry EIT's, depending on settings.
    //!
    //! The following tables can be merged: PAT, SDT, BAT, NIT. The EIT can also be
    //! merged, but in a different way. The PAT, SDT, BAT, NIT are fully merged.
    //! The two PAT, for instance, are merged into one single PAT containing all
    //! services from the two PAT's. The new PAT is cycled in replacement of the
    //! packets from the main stream containing the main PAT. All EIT's for the
    //! two streams are left unmodified but are mixed into one single PID. The
    //! mixed stream of EIT's is written in replacement of the EIT streams from
    //! the two streams.
