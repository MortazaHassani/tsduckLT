        //! the reset in the middle of an operation may be problematic. By using
        //! beforeCallingHandler() and afterCallingHandler(), all reset operations
        //! in between are delayed after the execution of the handler.
        //!
        //! Example:
        //! @code
        //! beforeCallingHandler(pid);
        //! try {
        //!     _handler->handleEvent(*this, pid, ...);

        //!     afterCallingHandler(false);
        //!     throw;
        //! }
        //! afterCallingHandler();
        //! @endcode

        //! @param [in] pid The PID for which the handler will be called. All reset
