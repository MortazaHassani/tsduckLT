    //! Cyclic packetization of MPEG sections into Transport Stream packets.
    //! @ingroup mpeg
    //!
    //! A CyclingPacketizer contains various sections to be packetized on one PID.
    //!
    //! All packets are generated on demand. The generated packets have
    //! the right PID and continuity counters and can be directly injected
    //! in a transport stream.
    //!
    //! The "cycle" of the packetizer is defined as the smallest set of TS
    //! packets containing all sections, with respect to the broadcasting
    //! constraints (stuffing, specific repetition rates, etc).
    //!
    //! It is possible to set different repetition rates for sections.
    //! In that case, the target "bitrate" of the PID must be specified.
    //! The sections are inserted on a best effort basis to respect the
    //! minimum repetition rates.
    //!
    //! When the packetizer bitrate is specified as zero (the default), the
    //! target bitrate of the PID is unspecified. The repetition rates of
    //! sections are ignored.
    //!
    //! Note that when sections have different repetition rates, some
    //! sections may be repeated into one cycle of the Packetizer.
    //!
    //! Section stuffing may occur at the end of a section. If the section
    //! ends in the middle of an MPEG packet, the beginning of the next section
    //! can start immediately or can be delayed to the beginning of the next
    //! packet. In the later case, the rest of the current packet is filled
    //! with stuffing bytes (0xFF).
    //!
    //! A bitrate is specified in bits/second. Zero means undefined.
    //! A repetition rate is specified in milliseconds. Zero means undefined.
    //!
