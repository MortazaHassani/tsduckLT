    //! In each PID with PCR's in the merged stream, we keep the first PCR
    //! value unchanged. Then, we need to adjust all subsequent PCR's.
    //! PCR's are system clock values. They must be synchronized with the
    //! transport stream rate. So, the difference between two PCR's shall
    //! be the transmission time in PCR units.
    //!
    //! We can compute new precise PCR values when the final bitrate is fixed.
    //! However, with a variable bitrate, our computed values will be inaccurate.
    //!
    //! Also note that we do not modify DTS and PTS. First, we can't access
    //! PTS and DTS in scrambled streams (unlike PCR's). Second, we MUST NOT
    //! change them because they indicate at which time the frame shall be
    //! _processed_, not _transmitted_.

        //! When restamping PCR's, the PCR adjustment is usually small and stays behind the PTS and DTS.
        //! But, after hours of continuous restamping, some inaccuracy my appear and the recomputed PCR
        //! may move ahead of PCR and DTS. Similarly, if there is a leap in the input PCR (such as a TS
        //! file looping back to the beginning), the difference between the adjusted PCR and input PTS/DTS

        //! With this option, as soon as a recomputed PCR is ahead of the PTS or DTS in the same packet,

        //! and restarts from the original PCR value in this packet. Note that, of course, this creates a
        //! small PCR leap in the stream.
