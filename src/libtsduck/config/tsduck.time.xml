    <!--
        The leap seconds are officially individually allocated in UTC starting June 30, 1972.
        At that date, the TAI (International Atomic Time) which started in 1958 was already
        10 seconds ahead of UTC. So, there are 10 leap seconds overall between 1958 and 1972
        without precise allocation.
