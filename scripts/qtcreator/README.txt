This directory contains project files to build TSDuck using Qt Creator.

TSDuck does not use Qt but these project files are an easy way to use
Qt Creator as general-purpose C++ IDE. These project files can be used on
Linux or macOS, indifferently.

Warning: Only use Qt Creator to develop and test TSDuck. Do not use the
created executables for delivery. To create executables for delivery, use
"make" on Linux and macOS.

On Windows, use Visual Studio as IDE. Also use it to create the delivery
product.
